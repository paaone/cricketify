# Cricketify

Simple starter scaffold for the Local Cricket Club app. The project is split
into a minimal Express backend and a Vite powered React frontend.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend (requires Node.js):

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

3. In a separate terminal start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run start
   ```

The frontend will run on <http://localhost:5173> and proxy API requests to the
backend on port `3001`.
